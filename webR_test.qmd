title: WebR - R in the web browser
webr:
  packages: ['ggplot2']
---

This is a WebR-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document. As the WebR documentation states: "WebR makes it possible to run R code in the browser without the need for an R server to execute the code: the R interpreter runs directly on the userâ€™s machine."

::: callout-warning
Use a Chrome or Firefox browser - WebR does not work with the Safari browser yet. If the following WebR chunk is working properly, you should see an editor window below the `Run code` tab displaying two lines of R code. 
:::

```{webr-r}
# Edit/add code here
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=am,y=mpg)) + 
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
