Factors can be used to add more understandable labels to data, but they do not support ordinal data.\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Question 2\nWhich of the following R code snippets correctly demonstrates valid methods for subsetting data?\n\n x[2], x[“name”], x[x &gt; 5] x[2], x[“name”], x[grep(“pattern”, x)] x[2], x[“name”], x[!is.na(x)] x[“name”], x[TRUE], x[order(x)]\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Question 3\nWhich of the following R code snippets best illustrates how NA values can interfere with subsetting, where x is c(1, 6, NA, 8)?\n\n x[!is.na(x)] x[2] x[1:3] x[x &gt; 5]",

    "text": "13.6 Using Conditionals Inside Functions\n\nWe’ve used a conditional to estimate mass differently for different types of vegetation\nThis is the kind of code we are going to want to reuse, so let’s move it into a function\nWe do this by placing the same code inside of a function\nAnd making sure that the function takes all required variables as input\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWe can then run this function with different vegetation types and get different estimates for mass\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nLet’s walk through how this code executes using the debugger\nWhen we call the function the first thing that happens is that 1.6 gets assigned to volume and \"tree\" gets assigned to veg_type\nThe code then checks to see if veg_type is equal to \"shrub\"\nIt isn’t so the code then checks to see if veg_type is equal to \"grass\"\nIt isn’t so the code then hits the else statement and executes the code in the else block\nIt assigns NA to mass\nIt then finishes the if/else if/else statement and returns the value for mass, which is NA to the global environment\n\n\n13.6.1 Task: Size Estimates by Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo Size Estimates by Name\n\n13.6.1.1 Part I\nThe length of an organism is typically strongly correlated with its body mass. This is useful because it allows us to estimate the mass of an organism even if we only know its length. This relationship generally takes the form:\n\nmass = a * length^b\n\nWhere the parameters a and b vary among groups. This allometric approach is regularly used to estimate the mass of dinosaurs since we cannot weigh something that is only preserved as bones.\nThe following function estimates the mass of an organism in kg based on its length in meters for a particular set of parameter values, those for Theropoda (where a has been estimated as 0.73 and b has been estimated as 3.63; Seebacher 2001).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nUse this function to print out the mass of a Theropoda that is 16 m long based on its reassembled skeleton.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCreate a new version of this function called get_mass_from_length() that takes length, a and b as arguments and uses the following code to estimate the mass mass &lt;- a * length ^ b. Use this function to estimate the mass of a Sauropoda (a = 214.44, b = 1.46) that is 26 m long.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.6.1.2 Part II\nTo make it even easier to work with your dinosaur size estimation functions you decide to create a function that lets you specify which dinosaur group you need to estimate the size of by name and then have the function automatically choose the right parameters.\nCreate a new function get_mass_from_length_by_name() that takes two arguments, the length and the name of the dinosaur group. Inside this function use if/else if/else statements to check to see if the name is one of the following values and if so use the associated a and b values to estimate the species mass.\n\nStegosauria: a = 10.95 and b = 2.64 (Seebacher 2001).\nTheropoda: a = 0.73 and b = 3.63 (Seebacher 2001).\nSauropoda: a = 214.44 and b = 1.46 (Seebacher 2001).\n\nIf the name is not any of these values the function should return NA.\nRun the function for: 1. A Stegosauria that is 10 meters long. 2. A Theropoda that is 8 meters long. 3. A Sauropoda that is 12 meters long. 4. A Ankylosauria that is 13 meters long.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nChallenge (optional): If the name is not one of values that have a and b values print out a message that it doesn’t know how to convert that group that includes that groups name in a message like “No known estimation for Ankylosauria”. (the function paste() will be helpful here). Doing this successfully will modify your answer to (4), which is fine.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nChallenge (optional): Change your function so that it uses two different values of a and b for Stegosauria. When Stegosauria is greater than 8 meters long use the equation above. When it is less than 8 meters long use a = 8.5 and b = 2.8. Run the function for a Stegosauria that is 6 meters long.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nChallenge (optional): Rewrite your function so that instead of calculating mass directly it sets the values of a and b to the values for the species (or to NA if the species doesn’t have an equation) and then calls another function to do the basic mass = a * length ^ b calculation.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

This is useful because it allows us to estimate the mass of an organism even if we only know its length. This relationship generally takes the form:\n\nmass = a * length^b\n\nWhere the parameters a and b vary among groups. This allometric approach is regularly used to estimate the mass of dinosaurs since we cannot weigh something that is only preserved as bones.\nThe following function estimates the mass of an organism in kg based on its length in meters for a particular set of parameter values, those for Theropoda (where a has been estimated as 0.73 and b has been estimated as 3.63; Seebacher 2001).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nUse this function to print out the mass of a Theropoda that is 16 m long based on its reassembled skeleton.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCreate a new version of this function called get_mass_from_length() that takes length, a and b as arguments and uses the following code to estimate the mass mass &lt;- a * length ^ b.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUse this function to estimate the mass of a Sauropoda (a = 214.44, b = 1.46) that is 26 m long.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

How do we combine these?\nThere are several ways of doing this; the method we will learn about today is using pipes.\nThe pipe operator %&gt;% lets us pipe the output of one command into the next.

For this exercise it doesn’t matter which function you choose.\nCan you reverse the ranking order so that the country with the longest life expectancy gets the lowest rank? Hint: This is similar to sorting in reverse order\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to challenge 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo reverse the order of the ranking, use the desc function, i.e. mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(lifeExp)))\nThere are several functions for calculating ranks; you may have used, e.g. dense_rank() The min_rank and dense_rank functions handle ties differently. The help file for dplyr’s ranking functions explains the differences, and can be accessed with ?dense_rank or ?min_rank.",

    "text": "21.5 Exercise 1\nRead in and set up the data set b, a cleaned version of our simulated data set:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction from Data Carpentry\n\n\n\nPlotting with ggplot2\nggplot2 is a plotting package that provides helpful commands to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.\nUse long format data\nggplot2 plots work best with data in the ‘long’ format, i.e., a column for every variable, and a row for every observation. Well-structured data will save you lots of time when making figures with ggplot2\nBuild layer by layer\nggplot graphics are built layer by layer by adding new elements. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.\nBasic template\nTo build a ggplot, we will use the following basic template that can be used for different types of plots:\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nNotes\n\nAnything you put in the ggplot() function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x- and y-axis you set up in aes().\nYou can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the aesthetics defined globally in the ggplot() function.\nThe + sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing a layer. If, instead, the + sign is added in the line before the other layer, ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.\nYou may notice that we sometimes reference ggplot2 and sometimes ggplot. To clarify, ggplot2 is the name of the most recent version of the package. However, any time we call the function itself, it’s just called ggplot().\n\nKey Points\n\nStart simple and build your plots iteratively.\nThe ggplot() function initiates a plot.\nUse aes() when mapping a variable from the data to a part of the plot\ngeom_ functions add representations of your data.\nUse facet_ to partition a plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset.\n\nAdditional Points\nThese points are not illustrated here in this current exercise:\n\nUse premade theme_ functions to broadly change appearance, and the theme() function to fine-tune\nThe patchwork library can combine separate plots into a single figure\nUse ggsave() to save plots in your favorite format and dimensions\n\nSee &lt;https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/instructor/04-visualization-ggplot2.html for further details.\n\n\nStarting with the data set b, use ggplot’s framework\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nto plot ind vs. t, coloring by case-control status (trait).

They are usually created with &lt;-.\n\n\n\n\ndata-variables are “statistical” variables that live in a data frame. They usually come from data files (e.g. .csv, .xls), or are created manipulating existing variables.\n\n\n\nWhen you have the data-variable in a function argument (i.e. an env-variable that holds a promise), you need to embrace the argument by surrounding it in doubled braces, like filter(df, {{ var }})\n\n\n\n21.21.2 Example function\nNote that here we are going to use the very flexible ... function argument.\nSee http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html for a detailed description of how this function argument works. In brief, they explain that:\n\nThere is a special argument called ... . This argument will match any arguments not otherwise matched, and can be easily passed on to other functions. This is useful if you want to collect arguments to call another function, but you don’t want to prespecify their possible names.\n\nSee also https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#plot-functions\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExample from: https://twitter.com/yutannihilat_en/status/1574387230025875457?s=20&t=FLbwErwEKQKWtKIGufDLIQ\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

You can then use slice to select the rows by position.\nAccording to its documentation, slice lets you index rows by their (integer) locations. It allows you to select, remove, and duplicate rows. Here’s an example combining slice and match where we have a data frame with row names and we want to select the rows in the order “A”, “B”, “C”:\n&gt; df\n  a b\nB 1 3\nC 2 2\nA 3 1\n&gt; match(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"),rownames(df))\n[1] 3 1 2\n&gt; df %&gt;% slice(match(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"),rownames(df)))\n  a b\nA 3 1\nB 1 3\nC 2 2\nHere the match vector of 3 1 2 tells us that row “A” is in position 3 in the rownames(df) vector, row “B” is in position 1, and row “C” is in position 2. So when we do slice(3,1,2) that moves row 3 into position 1, row 1 into position 2, and row 2 into position 3, as desired.\nIn our case, we can use match to get the positions of the VARNAME’s, and then use slice to rearrange the rows by position.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

When X is a data frame, sapply feeds each column of X into the FUN function, one by one. Here’s an example where we first apply the max function to each column of df, and then apply the min function to each column of df:\n&gt; df\n  a b c d\n1 3 4 1 2\n2 1 1 4 4\n3 4 2 2 1\n4 2 3 3 3\n&gt; sapply(df, max)\na b c d \n4 4 4 4 \n&gt; sapply(df, min)\na b c d \n1 1 1 1 \nSo we know that when using sapply on a data frame, its first argument is the name of the data frame (ds) and its second argument is the function that we wish to apply to each column of the data frame.\nHere, in the sapply(ds, function(x) {length(unique(x))}) command we are defining our own function as:\nfunction(x) {\n  length(unique(x))\n}\nWhen applied by sapply to each column of ds, this function will return the number of unique values in each column.\nThe same output can also be generated using the map function from the purrr R package.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nA similar related question is: How would you count the number of subjects who have more than one distinct measure at each of the phenotypes?\nTask: For each phenotype, total the count the number of subjects who have more than one distinct measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nOne approach for doing this would be to take the phenotype and group by subject_id and count distinct values within those subject-specific groups, and then add up the total number of subjects who have more than one distinct value.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe variables with a count of zero here are those where no more than 1 distinct value was observed for each subject.

Indeed, for the majority of these, the variable names are consistent with them being subject-level variables instead of variables that are measured every time a sample was taken.\nHere’s another solution for this problem, written by Tianze (Vincent) Luo, a student in our Fall 2024 HuGen 2071 course:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n24.5.3 Subject-level data set\nFor submission to dbGaP, we need to separate the phenotype data into subject-level data and sample-level data.\nThe dbGaP submission guide here\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/docs/submissionguide/#12-what-data-must-be-included-in\ndiscusses the distinction between sample-level phenotypes and subject-level phenotypes as follows:\n\nFor the Subject Phenotypes, it would be data relevant to the individual person. For the Sample Attributes, it would be data relevant to the sample derived from the person. For instance, do not list the RACE variable in the Sample Attributes, since RACE is stable for a person across samples. However, for variables like TREATMENT, if the person was only treated once, and data was collected, then TREATMENT could belong in the Subject Phenotypes table. However, if TREATMENT was completed multiple times, and each time a sample was extracted, then it would be better for TREATMENT to be tracked in the Sample Attributes table.\n\nHint: Remember that in the original study design, a blood sample was to be taken once per trimester. Each of these blood samples was assigned a sample ID, and for each of these, the trimester (1, 2, or 3) and the gestational age of the baby at the time of sampling was recorded. When the synthetic data were generated, not everyone ended up with exactly 3 samples.\nTask: Construct a subject-level data set ds.subj\nHow would you construct a subject-level data set?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to drop the sample-specific measures, retaining only subject-level measures, and then select unique records:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut there is a duplicated record where race differs but all other attributes are identical, so we filter one of those two records out:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote: When you notice a duplicated record like that, you should report the discrepancy back to the person primarily in charge of the data, so they can correct their source data.",

    "text": "24.3 Data Visualization in R\nThere are many tips and tricks that are available for the multitude of visualization packages in R. However, there aren’t as many simple rules or suggestions on what actually makes a good visualization. This starts with the “grammar of graphics”, which is the fundamental rules or principals which describe an art or science (from Wickham 2010).\n\n“A good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978)”\n\nBecause there are so many options and methods to plot our data in R, we need to think about how we are going to represent the data, how can that data be interpreted visually, and what story it may tell.\nA very nice example of this is provided by this animation (created by Darkhorse Analytics, and used in Jenny Bryan’s excellent stat545 course). It shows how simplification can make a big difference in communication.\n\n\n\nLess is more graphic\n\n\n\n24.3.1 Exploration vs. Communication\nOne thing to consider is what the objective is when creating a visualization or plot. When we build plots for exploratory purposes, we already know what the variables are we are using, and the objective is more about what sort of patterns the data might show. When communicating, the objective is more about providing a stand-alone snapshot which helps others understand what you are trying to convey.\n\n\n24.3.2 ggplot2\nWhile there are many visualization options in R, we believe the most comprehensive and powerful is the ggplot2 package. Much of the class has used/follows ggplot, so here’s a little background that might be useful.\n\nBased on Grammar of Graphics book by Leland Wilkinson hence ‘gg’\nEach part of the plot is layered or built upon the other parts (like building legos).\nConsider parts of a ggplot2 as parts of a house.\n\nData = The materials the house is built from (ggplot(data=yourdata))\nPlot Type = The structure/design of your house (how will it look?) (geom_)\nAesthetics = What the exterior looks like, i.e., the paint/decor (aes())\nStats = Ways to wire or plumb your house…how to tie your data together, or transform it (stat_)\n\n\nA questions we often get asked when helping students with ggplot figures is, how can I put two y-axis on my graph? Short answer, with ggplot, you can’t. There is a good reason for this though, which is basically that the creators of ggplot2 believe that duel y-axis are confusing, eaisly misunderstood and not invertible (given a point on the plot space, you can not uniquely map it back to a point in the data space). We agree with this logic, and would urge you to never put two differnt y-axis on the same plot. Instead, make two separate graphs.",

It is fun to play around with color, but keep in mind not everyone sees color in the same way, and some folks cannot see certain spectrums of color (i.e., absence of blue or green receptors is common). See below for a example of what colorblindness may do…if you see numbers inside these circles, great, you have some blue/green retinal receptors.\n \nHaving said that, here’s a great cheat sheet of colors in R, it can be handy when trying to find the correct color or name of a color. Check out this recent Nature perspective piece on The misuse of colour in science communication.\n\n24.4.1 Discrete/Categorical:\nFor a very nice discussion about color palettes, I recommend this page from the R cookbook folks.\nAdditionally, check out the great ggthemes package, which has many options. One I find very helpful is using scale_color_colorblind(), which if you have 8-9 categories, may be a nice way to display your data.\n\n\n24.4.2 Continuous: viridis\nThe viridis package is an excellent set of colors that better represent your data, are easier to read for those with colorblindness, and they also tend to print fairly well in grayscale.\nTake a look at the vignette online!\nAn example:\n\n\n\nviridis\n\n\n\n\n24.4.3 Customizing color pallettes in ggplot\nThe viridis color pallettes have been built into ggplot so that you can call upon them using the scale_fill_viridis_ or scale_color_viridis_ functions. Note that whether or not you use the fill or color scale function depends on which aesthetic you set in your plot. The functions also have extenstions depending on the kind of variable that you want to color: scale_fill_viridis_d is for discrete variables while scale_fill_viridis_c is for continous variables. Within the function, you can specify which virids pallette to use: A-D.\nIn this example we fill in our bars with the cut vairable in the diamond dataset, a categorical variable with 5 groups.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = clarity, fill = cut)) + \n  geom_bar() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=70, vjust=0.5)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"C\") +\n  theme_classic()",

Data visualization is effective when it is simple, and repackages data into a visual story that is easy to understand.\n\nLabel appropriately and legibly, including axes, and use text to highlight important bits\nUse one color to represent each category, consider colorblind/BW friendly palettes\nOrder datasets using logical heirarchy (Make it easy for reader to compare values)\nUse icons when possible to reduce unnecessary labeling\nPay attention to scale (e.g., start axis at zero not 2.4 to 3.5)\nInclude your data/outliers where possible\nBe sure to increase your font size early on, as most journals require a large font size at time of publication.\n\n\n\n24.5.2 Visualization Don’ts\nA few things to avoid (which basically relates to keeping it simple):\n\nDon’t try to add too much into one plot…keep it simple\nDon’t add color uncessarily unless it provides a specific function\nAvoid high contrast colors (red/green or blue/yellow)\nDon’t use 3D charts. They can make it hard to discern or perceive the actual information.\nAvoid ornamentation (shadowing, extra illustration, etc)\nAvoid more than 6 categorical colors in a layout unless you looking at continuous data.\nKeep fonts simple (avoid uncessary bold or italicization)\nDon’t try to compare too many categories or data types in one chart\n\n\n\n24.5.3 Examples\n\n24.5.3.1 Scatterplots\nOne of the best simple plots for examining patterns in data, but very effective.

For instance this univariate plot of iris petal width visually looks like this:\n\nplot(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing sonify instead of plot, the distribution of iris petal width sounds like this:\n\n#install.packages(\"sonify\")\nlibrary(sonify)\nsonify(iris$Petal.Width, play = FALSE)\n\nIf you try this on your computer it should play autmatically, buy on the website you can listen below:\n\n\n\nTwo variables can be used as input to hear the relationship between continuous variables.

The first and foremost is a package by Claus Wilke called cowplot. With cowplot, it’s possible to quickly combine existing ggplots, creating publication quality plots. See the vignette for more options, but here’s a quick example from the vignette below:\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\n# make a few plots:\nplot.diamonds &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill = cut)) + \n  geom_bar() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=70, vjust=0.5))\n#plot.diamonds\n\nplot.cars &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) + \n   geom_point(size = 2.5)\n#plot.cars\n\nplot.iris &lt;- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, fill=Species)) +\n  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7, shape=21)\n#plot.iris\n\n# use plot_grid\npanel_plot &lt;- plot_grid(plot.cars, plot.iris, plot.diamonds, labels=c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), ncol=2, nrow = 2)\n\npanel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fix the sizes draw_plot\nfixed_gridplot &lt;- ggdraw() + draw_plot(plot.iris, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = 0.5) +\n           draw_plot(plot.cars, x=0, y=.5, width=0.5, height = 0.5) +\n           draw_plot(plot.diamonds, x=0.5, y=0.5, width=0.5, height = 0.5) + \n  draw_plot_label(label = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"), x = c(0, 0.5, 0), y = c(1, 1, 0.5))\n\nfixed_gridplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.7.2 patchwork\nThe patchwork R library can also be used to assemble multi-part figures.\nGetting Started with Patchwork: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nplot.diamonds + plot.cars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(plot.diamonds | plot.cars) / plot.iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags can be easily added to a set of plots, using the plot_annotation command:\n\nplots &lt;- (plot.diamonds | plot.cars) / plot.iris\nplots + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')",

    "text": "24.9 Interactive plotly graphics\nThe plotly R package provides an interface to the open source JavaScript graphing library ploty.js.\nggplotly(): transform a ggplot2 object into a plotly object.\nplot_ly(): directly create a plotly object.\nSee the book “Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny” by Carson Sievert at https://plotly-r.com\nSee also the comparison here\n\n24.9.1 How to use plotly\nThe package plotly is an excellent, easy to use resource that allows you to quickly create interactive, web-based figures. We have used plotly to illustrate patterns in data to collaborators, to visualize patterns in our data during the pre-analysis stage, and even impress with “fancy” graphics during a conference talk!\nLet’s try plotly together using some of the iris data:\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(crosstalk)\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\n\nplot.iris &lt;- ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, fill=Species)) +\n  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7, shape=21)\n\nplotly::ggplotly(plot.iris) #it's as simple as that! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.9.2 Customizing labels\nIt is possible to customize the labels using the ggplot2 text aesthetic to provide more information.\nExample at this link: https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/interactiveplots\nHere’s an example of how to generate a custom tool tip containing information from several columns of the input iris data frame:\n\nplot.iris &lt;- ggplot(data=iris, \n   aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, fill=Species,\n   text=paste(\"Species: \",Species,\"\\n\",\n              \"Sepal Length: \",Sepal.Length,\"\\n\",\n              \"Sepal Width:  \",Sepal.Width,\"\\n\",\n              \"Petal Length: \",Petal.Length,\"\\n\",\n              \"Petal Width:  \",Petal.Width,\"\\n\",\n              sep=\"\"))) +\n  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7, shape=21)\n\nplotly::ggplotly(plot.iris, tooltip=\"text\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.9.3 Animated Interactive Plots\nAnimated interactive plots using the ’frame’ attribute.\nExample at this link: https://slcladal.github.io/motion.html\nSee also the gganimate R package https://cran.r-project.org/package=gganimate.\n\n\n24.9.4 Interactive Linked Plots\nThe plotly package, when combined with the crosstalk package, supports linked plots, where selection of points in one plot highlights them in the other plots. This is known as “linked brushing”.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(crosstalk)\nd &lt;- SharedData$new(iris)\np &lt;- GGally::ggpairs(d, aes(color = Species), columns = c(1,2,3))\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':\n  method from   \n  +.gg   ggplot2\n\nhighlight(ggplotly(p), on = \"plotly_selected\")\n\nWarning: Can only have one: highlight\n\nWarning: Can only have one: highlight\n\n\nSetting the `off` event (i.e., 'plotly_deselect') to match the `on` event (i.e., 'plotly_selected'). You can change this default via the `highlight()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.9.5 Interactive Manhattan plots\nThe manhattan command from the qqman R package provides an easy way to make Manhattan plots, but interactive annotated plots can be made using ggplotly.\nAlso note that for static plots, the ggrepel R package can be used to annotate with SNP names.\nSee this web page for examples at this link.\nIn particular, note in the examples:\n\nHow ggrepel is used for the annotation.\nThe interactive version made with plotly.\n\nSee also LocusZoom at http://locuszoom.org\n\n\n24.9.6 CRAN Task View: Dynamic Visualizations and Interactive Graphics\nFor an overview of R packages that are useful in this area, see the CRAN Task View: Dynamic Visualizations and Interactive Graphics at https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/DynamicVisualizations.html",

I usually do this by looking up the base pair positions of a couple of SNPs by hand in the ‘SNP’ data base. So if we go there and search for rs3800143, we end up on this web page:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs3800143#variant_details\nwhich shows a Build GRCh37.p13 position of 1942538 on chromosome 6. So it looks like Build GRCh37.p13 was used, which is also known as Build hg19.\nTo double check, we can check that the given position for rs10836914 matches the Build GRCh37.p13 position.\nSo to determine the gene boundaries in Build hg19, we need to download and install the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene library from BioConductor.\nSo we search for it on BioConductor and that it can be installed by issuing these commands at the R prompt:\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\nBiocManager::install(\"TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene\")\nYou will also need to install another library, org.Hs.eg.db:\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\nBiocManager::install(\"org.Hs.eg.db\")",

Now let’s try to generalize what we did above:\nTask: Using GRanges and associated Bioconductor tools, write a function that takes as input a ranked list of the SNPS, and returns a nice table that lists the top N of these SNPs and any gene that they might be in, including the SNP position and the gene boundaries.\n# snp.list = the ranked list of the top SNPs\n# N = the number of top SNPs to annotate\nsnp.table &lt;- function(snp.list, N=15) {\n  \n}\nApply your snp.table function to the top 15 SNPs in our example data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nUse the subsetByOverlaps followed by the select(org.Hs.eg.db, ... approach described above in the Search for match and Convert Entrez Gene IDs to Gene Names sections above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see solution\n\n\n\n\n\n25.12 Answer 2\nIt is important to understand what the output of the findOverlaps function means.\ntop.snp.gene &lt;- findOverlaps(gene.bounds, top.snp)\ntop.snp.gene\nreturns:\nHits object with 10 hits and 0 metadata columns:\n       queryHits subjectHits\n       &lt;integer&gt;

    "text": "25.13 Question 3\nTask: Using GRanges and associated Bioconductor tools, write a function that takes as input a ranked list of the SNPS, and returns a nice table that lists the top N of these SNPs and the closest flanking genes on both sides, including the SNP position and the gene boundaries.\n# snp.list = the ranked list of the top SNPs\n# N = the number of top SNPs to annotate\nsnp.flank &lt;- function(snp.list, N=15) {\n \n}\nApply your snp.flank function to the top 15 SNPs in our example data set.\nNote that the purpose here is to think more about how to creatively use GRanges than to search for nice annotation packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nThe GenomicRanges package has a useful function nearest that can be used to find the nearest gene.\nNote that if we want to augment information about the nearest gene with the genes that precede and follow each top SNP, we could use functions like this:\ngenes &lt;- genes(txdb, columns = \"gene_id\")\nprecede(top.snp, genes)\nfollow(top.snp, genes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see solution\n\n\n\n\n\n25.14 Answer 3\nNote that we need to set up the txdb object within the function itself to avoid creating a dependence on the global txdb object. Although, it might be more efficient to create the txdb object once and pass it in via a function parameter instead of recreating it each time the function is called.\nHere we use require statements to indicate dependence on certain libraries having been loaded, but if this were part of an R package, we’d take care of library dependencies at the package level instead of inside of specific functions. Usually when writing functions, we assume that all of the required packages have been loaded, so we tend not to use the library or the require command within functions.\n\n# snp.list = the ranked list

    "text": "25.14 Answer 3\nNote that we need to set up the txdb object within the function itself to avoid creating a dependence on the global txdb object. Although, it might be more efficient to create the txdb object once and pass it in via a function parameter instead of recreating it each time the function is called.\nHere we use require statements to indicate dependence on certain libraries having been loaded, but if this were part of an R package, we’d take care of library dependencies at the package level instead of inside of specific functions. Usually when writing functions, we assume that all of the required packages have been loaded, so we tend not to use the library or the require command within functions.\n\n# snp.list = the ranked list

    "text": "28.3 Strange R behavior\nJune Choe shared this on Mastodon\nhttps://fosstodon.org/@yjunechoe/111026163637396686\nA student in my intro #rstats class taught me something new today (by way of a cryptic “bug”).\nSuppose you’re asked why this {purrr} code that should return the mean of each list element is not working as expected.\nmap(list(x=1:3, y=4:6), mean)\n#&gt; $x\n#&gt; [1] 1\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $y\n#&gt; [1] 4\nWhat do you think is the simplest explanation for this behavior (in terms of the mistake that the student could’ve made)? It’s not so obvious - there are multiple R “quirks” cascading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nset.seed(123)\nmean &lt;- mean(sample(2, 10, replace=TRUE))\nmean\n\n[1] 1.4\n\n# These means are correct\nmean(1:3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nmean(4:6)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# These means are correct:\nlapply(list(x=1:3, y=4:6), mean)\n\n$x\n[1] 2\n\n$y\n[1] 5\n\n# But these means are incorrect:\nmap(list(x=1:3, y=4:6), mean)\n\n$x\n[1] 1\n\n$y\n[1] 4\n\n\nWhy are the means computed using the map function from the purrr package incorrect?\nIt is not applying the mean function, but rather it is applying the mean variable, which has a value of 1.4.\nAs the map documentation states, while the map command is typically used to apply a function in its .f argument, the .f argument can also accept an integer - when it does so, it is interpreted as follows:\n\nA string, integer, or list, e.g. \"idx\", 1, or list(\"idx\", 1) which are shorthand for pluck(x, \"idx\"), pluck(x, 1), and pluck(x, \"idx\", 1) respectively.\n\nSo when we map using the mean variable, it is used as an index to pluck elements out of the list - during the double to integer conversion, it is rounded down to 1, so it plucks the first element of each list.\n\nmap(list(x=1:3, y=4:6), 1.4)\n\n$x\n[1] 1\n\n$y\n[1] 4\n\nmap(list(x=1:3, y=4:6), 1)\n\n$x\n[1] 1\n\n$y\n[1] 4\n\n\nMoral: Be careful to avoid using existing R function names, like mean, as the names of your variables.\nRelevant discussion can be found in\nhttps://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#functions-versus-variables\nwhere it is stated:\n\n“For the record, using the same name for different things is confusing and best avoided!”",
