### Required Readings

**GitHub Classroom Guide for Students**

To set up GitHub Classroom, please follow the steps to set up RStudio, R, and git in this detailed guide: <https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students>

Choose your GitHub user name carefully, as later in your career you may end up using it in a professional context.

Be sure to generate an SSH key so you don't need to enter your password every time you interact with GitHub.

::: callout-warning
Do not clone your repository onto a OneDrive or other cloud folder, as git does not work properly on cloud drives. Cloud drive systems typically maintain their own backup copies and this confuses git.
